We plan to use this list of options for the wheel, taken from the Wheel of Fortune current wheel


[300, 500, 450, 500, 800, “Lose A Turn”, 700, 1000, 650, “Bankrupt”, 900, 500, 350, 600, 500, 400, 550, 800, 300, 700, 900, 500, 5000, 950]


Plan: We will track turns by a “turn” variable, which is an int that stores whose turn it currently is. 


We go for 3 rounds. We fix each thing 


Round 1 or 2


Player 1 takes turn. If they win, don’t go to player 2.
Player 2 takes turn. If they win, don’t go to player 3.
Player 3 takes turn. If they win, don’t loop.


Loop around back to player 1, and continue play.

-you spin the wheel
-you can always guess a consonant unless it lands on “lose a turn” or “bankrupt” or you choose to only guess the word 
-you have the option to buy a vowel if you get the consonant right. Pursuant to the actual wheel of fortune rules, you can also buy a vowel at the start of your turn
-if you get the consonant right, you can then guess the word. If you bought a vowel and got the vowel wrong, your turn ends. 


Recycle the hangman code for guessing both consonants and vowels. 


Then progress to the next turn. Keep progressing through turns until someone gets the word right


If someone gets the word right, increment the rounds


If we go to the final round, we find the person with the highest score via a loop that checks each score against the others, saving the highest value. In that case, we will only be paying that person in the final round.


Write a separate function for the final round, which is separate from everything else, since it has a dramatically different structure. Keep the character guessing function.
